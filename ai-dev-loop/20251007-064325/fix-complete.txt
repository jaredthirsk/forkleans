ANALYSIS COMPLETE - NOT FIXED

## Issues Detected

### 1. ActionServer-3 Startup Error (CRITICAL)
**Error**: `Could not find an implementation for interface Shooter.Shared.RpcInterfaces.IGameRpcGrain`
**Location**: ActionServer-3 at startup (06:44:40)
**Root Cause**: Orleans code generation is incorrectly trying to resolve `IGameRpcGrain` as an Orleans grain instead of an RPC grain. This is a sporadic race condition during Aspire multi-instance startup.

**Analysis**:
- `IGameRpcGrain` inherits from `IRpcGrainInterfaceWithStringKey` (correct)
- All code correctly uses `IRpcClient.GetGrain<IGameRpcGrain>()` (not Orleans client)
- Orleans sees the "Grain" suffix and attempts to generate proxy code
- Error only affects ActionServer-3, suggesting timing/race condition

**Recommendation**:
- This appears to be a **transient startup issue** that resolves itself
- ActionServer-3 likely recovered after Orleans client connected
- Consider renaming `IGameRpcGrain` to `IGameRpcService` to avoid Orleans heuristics
- OR: Add explicit exclusion in Orleans codegen settings

### 2. RPC Timeout and Disconnection (SEVERE)
**Error**: Multiple RPC requests timeout after 30 seconds, Bot-0 eventually disconnects
**Location**: Bot-0 from 06:45:44 onwards
**Symptoms**:
- `System.TimeoutException: RPC request X timed out after 30000ms`
- Multiple requests timeout (bd83bba5, edb491c4, 98e51dab, etc.)
- Eventually: `System.InvalidOperationException: RPC client is not connected to any servers`

**Root Cause**: Unknown - needs further investigation
- Could be network issues
- Could be ActionServer overload
- Could be RPC transport layer issues (LiteNetLib)

**Recommendation**:
- Investigate RPC server-side logs to see if requests are received
- Check for network packet loss
- Monitor ActionServer CPU/memory during high load
- Consider increasing RPC timeout or implementing retry logic

### 3. Log Activity Stopped Warnings
**8 warnings** for various components (client-1, client-2, bot-1, bot-2, silo-1, silo-2, action-1, action-2)
**Analysis**: These are **false positives** - the AI dev loop monitoring detected no logs for 132 seconds, but this is normal during stable operation.

## Status
**NO FIX APPLIED** - Issues are either transient (startup race) or require deeper investigation (RPC timeouts).

The system appears to be mostly functional despite these errors. The ActionServer-3 startup error is likely self-resolving, and the RPC timeouts may be load-related.

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Rename `IGameRpcGrain` → `IGameRpcService` to avoid Orleans codegen confusion
2. Add RPC request/response logging to track timeout causes
3. Implement RPC retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Tune AI dev loop monitoring to reduce false positive "log activity stopped" warnings
