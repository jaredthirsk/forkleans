WARNINGS (0):


ANALYSIS:
- Connection/certificate issues preventing proper communication

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. For zone issues: Check zone transition logic and force reconnection
2. For RPC failures: Verify network configuration and retry logic
3. For SSL issues: Check certificate trust and SignalR endpoints
4. For bot issues: Verify connection URLs and authentication
