    Automatically disable official Orleans code generation when using Granville.Orleans packages.
    This prevents duplicate code generation errors when both Microsoft.Orleans and Granville.Orleans
    packages are present in the same project.
    
    To re-enable official Orleans code generation, set Orleans_DesignTimeBuild to false in your project file.
