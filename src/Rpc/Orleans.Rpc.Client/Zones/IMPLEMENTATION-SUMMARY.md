# Zone Detection Strategy Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a zone detection strategy system for Granville RPC that allows clients to route grain calls to specific RPC servers based on zone assignments. This was requested by the user to support zone-aware grains.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components Created

#### IZoneDetectionStrategy Interface
- Location: `/src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Zones/IZoneDetectionStrategy.cs`
- Provides two methods for determining zone IDs:
  - `GetZoneId(GrainId grainId)` - Using Orleans GrainId
  - `GetZoneId(GrainType grainType, string grainKey)` - Using separate type and key

#### ShooterZoneDetectionStrategy
- Location: `/src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Zones/ShooterZoneDetectionStrategy.cs`
- Shooter game-specific implementation
- Maps 1000x1000 world into 100 zones (10x10 grid)
- Includes helper methods:
  - `CalculateZoneFromPosition(float x, float y)` - Converts world coordinates to zone ID
  - `GetZoneBounds(int zoneId)` - Returns world bounds for a zone

#### GrainTypeBasedZoneDetectionStrategy
- Location: `/src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Zones/GrainTypeBasedZoneDetectionStrategy.cs`
- Generic strategy for mapping grain types to zones
- Supports pattern-based matching
- Runtime configuration via `AddMapping` and `RemoveMapping`

### 2. Integration Points

#### RpcConnectionManager Updates
- Added private field: `IZoneDetectionStrategy _zoneDetectionStrategy`
- Added method: `SetZoneDetectionStrategy(IZoneDetectionStrategy strategy)`
- Enhanced `GetConnectionForRequest` to use zone detection:
  1. First checks explicit `TargetZoneId` on request
  2. Then uses zone detection strategy if available
  3. Falls back to first available connection

#### RpcClient Updates
- Added constructor parameter: `IZoneDetectionStrategy zoneDetectionStrategy = null`
- Sets strategy on connection manager during initialization
- Logs zone detection strategy configuration

#### Service Registration
- Added to `DefaultRpcClientServices.cs`: Default null registration for `IZoneDetectionStrategy`
- Users can override with their own implementation

### 3. Extension Methods
- Created `RpcClientBuilderExtensions.cs` with helper methods:
  - `UseZoneDetectionStrategy<TStrategy>()` - Register strategy type
  - `UseZoneDetectionStrategy(IZoneDetectionStrategy)` - Register instance
  - `UseZoneDetectionStrategy<TStrategy>(Action<TStrategy>)` - Register with configuration

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive guide: `ZONE-DETECTION-GUIDE.md`
- Includes usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting tips

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Optional Feature**: Zone detection is completely optional - system works without it
2. **Pluggable Design**: Users can implement custom strategies via `IZoneDetectionStrategy`
3. **Lazy Resolution**: Zone detection happens at request time, not grain creation time
4. **Fallback Logic**: Always falls back to any available connection if zone routing fails
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting zone routing decisions

## Testing

The TestGetGrain sample was updated to demonstrate:
- How to configure zone detection via DI
- Integration with the RPC client
- No compilation or runtime errors with the new feature

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Configure client with zone detection
builder.UseZoneDetectionStrategy<GrainTypeBasedZoneDetectionStrategy>(strategy =>
{
    strategy.AddMapping("IPlayerGrain", 1001);
    strategy.AddMapping("IEnemyGrain", 1002);
});

// Or use the Shooter-specific strategy
builder.UseZoneDetectionStrategy<ShooterZoneDetectionStrategy>();
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Zone Updates**: Support for grains moving between zones
2. **Zone Load Balancing**: Consider server load when routing
3. **Zone Affinity**: Keep related grains in the same zone
4. **Metrics**: Track zone distribution and routing decisions

## Summary

The zone detection strategy implementation successfully addresses the user's request for "a strategy to map GrainIds to a particular ActionServer (RPC Server)". The system is flexible, extensible, and integrates cleanly with the existing RPC infrastructure without breaking changes.
