# Granville RPC Security Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security strategy for Granville RPC, focusing on protecting client-to-server communications over the internet while maintaining high performance characteristics of UDP-based communication.

## Security Architecture Vision

### Core Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
3. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal permissions required
4. **Performance-Aware**: Security measures that don't compromise RPC performance goals
5. **Configurable Security**: Allow administrators to tune security vs performance trade-offs

## Authentication & Authorization Framework

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Client Role**: Basic access for game clients and application consumers
- **Server Role**: Elevated permissions for server-to-server communication
- **Specialized-Server Role**: For specific services like ActionServers in Shooter
- **Admin Role**: Full access for management operations

### RpcGrain Authorization
- Implement attribute-based authorization for RpcGrains
- Configure which roles can create/access specific grain types
- Support for method-level authorization within grains

## Security Layers

### 1. Network Layer Security
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and connection throttling
- **IP Allowlisting/Denylisting**: Configurable IP-based access control
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Optional geo-IP filtering
- **Port Security**: Minimal port exposure, configurable port ranges

### 2. Transport Layer Security
- **DTLS for UDP**: Implement DTLS 1.3 for encrypted UDP communication
- **Certificate Management**: PKI infrastructure for server authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session establishment and resumption
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ensure past sessions remain secure

### 3. Application Layer Security
- **Message Authentication**: HMAC or similar for message integrity
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Nonce/timestamp-based protection
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all RPC parameters
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### 4. Identity & Access Management
- **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT or similar for client authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for sensitive operations
- **Identity Federation**: Support for external identity providers
- **Session Management**: Secure session lifecycle management

## Threat Model

### Primary Threats
1. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting/modifying RPC communications
2. **Replay Attacks**: Resending captured packets
3. **DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelming servers with traffic
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Consuming server resources maliciously
5. **Unauthorized Access**: Accessing restricted RpcGrains or methods
6. **Data Exfiltration**: Stealing sensitive game/application data
7. **Code Injection**: Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities
8. **Session Hijacking**: Taking over authenticated sessions

### Attack Surface Analysis
- UDP endpoints exposed to internet
- RPC message deserialization points
- Authentication/authorization decision points
- Session management interfaces
- Administrative interfaces

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
- Implement basic authentication framework
- Add role-based authorization to RpcGrains
- Create security configuration system
- Implement basic rate limiting

### Phase 2: Transport Security (Short-term)
- Integrate DTLS for UDP encryption
- Implement certificate management
- Add message authentication codes
- Deploy replay attack prevention

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium-term)
- Implement full RBAC system
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Create security event logging
- Deploy anomaly detection

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Long-term)
- Identity federation support
- Advanced threat detection
- Compliance reporting
- Security automation tools

## Configuration Examples

### RpcGrain Authorization Attributes
```csharp
[RpcGrain]
[RequireRole("server", "specialized-server")]
public class ActionServerGrain : RpcGrain
{
    [RequireRole("admin")]
    public Task<Result> AdminOperation() { }
    
    [RequireRole("client", "server")]
    public Task<Result> StandardOperation() { }
}
```

### Security Configuration
```json
{
  "RpcSecurity": {
    "EnableDTLS": true,
    "RequireAuthentication": true,
    "RateLimiting": {
      "MaxConnectionsPerIP": 10,
      "MaxRequestsPerSecond": 100
    },
    "Authorization": {
      "DefaultRequiredRole": "client",
      "GrainTypeRoles": {
        "ActionServerGrain": ["server", "specialized-server"],
        "AdminGrain": ["admin"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing Types
1. **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks on RPC endpoints
2. **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing
3. **Performance Testing**: Security overhead measurement
4. **Compliance Testing**: Verify security controls
5. **Red Team Exercises**: Full attack simulations

### Test Scenarios
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization escalation tests
- DDoS simulation
- Replay attack verification
- Session hijacking attempts
- Resource exhaustion tests

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time connection monitoring
- Anomaly detection systems
- Security event correlation
- Performance impact tracking

### Incident Response Plan
1. Detection and alerting
2. Initial assessment
3. Containment measures
4. Investigation procedures
5. Recovery processes
6. Post-incident review

## Compliance Considerations

### Standards Alignment
- OWASP guidelines for secure development
- NIST cybersecurity framework
- Industry-specific requirements (gaming, financial, healthcare)

### Audit Requirements
- Security event logging
- Access audit trails
- Configuration change tracking
- Compliance reporting

## Performance Considerations

### Security/Performance Trade-offs
- Encryption overhead analysis
- Authentication caching strategies
- Connection pooling with security
- Optimized security checks

### Benchmarking Goals
- < 1ms additional latency for authentication
- < 5% CPU overhead for encryption
- Minimal memory footprint for security state
- No impact on throughput for authorized requests

## Developer Guidance

### Security Best Practices
1. Always validate input parameters
2. Use provided security attributes
3. Avoid storing sensitive data in grains
4. Follow secure coding guidelines
5. Regular security training

### Common Pitfalls
