# RPC Client Multiplexer Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The Shooter game client was experiencing connection drops during zone transitions because `RpcClient` was being disposed and recreated each time a player moved between zones. This caused:
- "RPC client is not connected to any servers" errors
- GetGrain timeouts
- Interrupted gameplay

## Solution Overview

We implemented an RPC Client Multiplexer that:
1. Maintains persistent connections to multiple servers
2. Routes grain requests to appropriate servers based on configurable strategies
3. Handles server health monitoring and automatic reconnection
4. Enables seamless zone transitions without connection drops

## Implementation Components

### Core Interfaces

1. **IServerDescriptor** (`IServerDescriptor.cs`)
   - Describes a server with metadata, health status, and connection info

2. **IGrainRoutingStrategy** (`IGrainRoutingStrategy.cs`)
   - Interface for routing strategies to select servers for grain requests

3. **IRpcClientMultiplexer** (`IRpcClientMultiplexer.cs`)
   - Main interface matching RpcClient API but supporting multiple servers

### Core Implementation

1. **RpcClientMultiplexer** (`RpcClientMultiplexer.cs`)
   - Manages pool of RPC client connections
   - Routes grain requests using configured strategy
   - Monitors server health
   - Handles connection lifecycle

2. **RpcClientConnection** (`RpcClientConnection.cs`)
   - Manages individual server connections
   - Implements exponential backoff for reconnection
   - Tracks connection state and health

3. **RpcClientMultiplexerOptions** (`RpcClientMultiplexerOptions.cs`)
   - Configuration for connection timeouts, health checks, retry policies

### Routing Strategies

1. **ZoneBasedRoutingStrategy** (`Strategies/ZoneBasedRoutingStrategy.cs`)
   - Routes zone-aware grains to servers handling specific zones
   - Requires grains to implement `IZoneAwareGrain`

2. **ServiceBasedRoutingStrategy** (`Strategies/ServiceBasedRoutingStrategy.cs`)
   - Maps grain types to specific servers
   - Supports attribute-based configuration

3. **CompositeRoutingStrategy** (`Strategies/CompositeRoutingStrategy.cs`)
   - Combines multiple strategies with predicates
   - Allows complex routing rules

### Dependency Injection

1. **RpcClientMultiplexerServiceExtensions** (`Hosting/RpcClientMultiplexerServiceExtensions.cs`)
   - Extension methods for service registration
   - Fluent builder API for configuration

### Shooter Game Integration

1. **MultiplexedRpcGameClientService** (`granville/samples/Rpc/Shooter.Client.Common/MultiplexedRpcGameClientService.cs`)
   - Drop-in replacement for GranvilleRpcGameClientService
   - Uses multiplexer for all RPC operations
   - Implements custom ShooterRoutingStrategy

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Connection Pooling**: Maintains persistent connections rather than creating/disposing
2. **Lazy Connection**: Connects to servers on first use by default
3. **Health Monitoring**: Periodic health checks with configurable intervals
4. **Routing Context**: Passes contextual information (like zone) for routing decisions
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Multiplexer API matches RpcClient for easy migration

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Configure services
services.AddRpcClientMultiplexerWithBuilder(options =>
{
    options.EnableHealthChecks = true;
    options.HealthCheckInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
})
.UseCompositeRouting(composite =>
{
    // Zone-based routing for game grains
    composite.AddStrategy(
        type => typeof(IZoneAwareGrain).IsAssignableFrom(type),
        new ZoneBasedRoutingStrategy(logger));
    
    // Default to primary server
    composite.SetDefaultStrategy(new PrimaryServerStrategy());
});

// Register servers
var multiplexer = provider.GetRequiredService<IRpcClientMultiplexer>();
multiplexer.RegisterServer(new ServerDescriptor
{
    ServerId = "zone-1-0",
    HostName = "localhost",
    Port = 12003,
    Metadata = new Dictionary<string, string> { ["zone"] = "1,0" }
});

// Use with zone context
var context = new RoutingContext();
context.SetProperty("Zone", "1,0");
var grain = await multiplexer.GetGrainAsync<IGameRpcGrain>("game", context);
```

## Benefits

1. **No Connection Drops**: Zone transitions are seamless
2. **Better Performance**: Avoids connection setup overhead
3. **Scalability**: Supports many servers with intelligent routing
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic reconnection and health monitoring
5. **Flexibility**: Pluggable routing strategies

## Next Steps

1. Integration testing with multiple ActionServers
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Additional routing strategies (load-based, latency-based)
4. Enhanced health check mechanisms
5. Metrics and monitoring integration
