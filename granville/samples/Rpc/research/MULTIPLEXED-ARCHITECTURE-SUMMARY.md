# Multiplexed RPC Architecture Summary

## Problem Solved

1. **Immediate Issue**: `await hostBuilder.StartAsync()` was hanging because it waits for the host to terminate
   - Fixed by using `_ = hostBuilder.RunAsync()` instead

2. **Architectural Issue**: GranvilleRpcGameClientService was a singleton trying to manage multiple RPC connections
   - Mixed responsibilities (HTTP + RPC)
   - Complex connection lifecycle management
   - Difficult to maintain and debug

## New Architecture

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **SiloHttpService**: Handles all HTTP communication with the Orleans Silo
  - Player registration
  - World queries
  - Server discovery
  
- **RpcClientMultiplexer**: Manages multiple RPC connections
  - One connection per action server
  - Connection pooling and lifecycle management
  - Grain routing based on zones

- **MultiplexedGameClientService**: Orchestrates between HTTP and RPC
  - Uses SiloHttpService for global operations
  - Uses RpcClientMultiplexer for zone-specific operations
  - Handles zone transitions cleanly

### 2. **Key Benefits**

- **Clean separation**: HTTP vs RPC responsibilities are clearly separated
- **Scalable**: Can connect to multiple action servers simultaneously
- **Efficient**: Pre-establishes connections to nearby zones
- **Maintainable**: Each component has a single responsibility

### 3. **Zone Transition Flow**

1. Player moves to new zone boundary
2. MultiplexedGameClientService detects zone change
3. Queries Silo (HTTP) for new action server assignment
4. Uses RpcClientMultiplexer to connect to new server (if not already connected)
5. Updates routing strategy to route grains to new server
6. Seamless transition with pre-established connections

### 4. **Connection Management**

- **Pre-establishment**: Connects to adjacent zones proactively
- **Cleanup**: Disconnects from distant zones after timeout
- **Pooling**: Reuses existing connections when possible
- **Routing**: Zone-based routing strategy directs grain calls

## Migration Path

To use the new architecture:

```csharp
// In Program.cs or Startup.cs
services.AddMultiplexedGameClient();

// Configure RPC client
Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureShooterRpcClient()
    .Build();

// In your game component
var gameClient = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<MultiplexedGameClientService>();
await gameClient.InitializeAsync(playerId, playerName);

// Game loop
while (playing)
{
    var worldState = await gameClient.GetWorldStateAsync();
    await gameClient.UpdatePlayerInputAsync(playerInput);
}
```

## Files Created

1. `/Shooter.Client.Common/Services/SiloHttpService.cs` - HTTP communication service
2. `/Shooter.Client.Common/Services/MultiplexedGameClientService.cs` - Main game client using multiplexer
3. `/Shooter.Client.Common/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` - DI registration helpers

## Next Steps

1. Update Shooter.Client to use MultiplexedGameClientService instead of GranvilleRpcGameClientService
2. Test zone transitions with multiple action servers
3. Monitor connection pool efficiency
4. Add telemetry for connection metrics
