# GameEventBroker Fix for IGameRpcGrain Registration Issue

## Problem
The critical error "Could not find an implementation for interface IGameRpcGrain" was occurring because WorldSimulation was trying to get an RPC grain through the Orleans client. RPC grains are not registered with Orleans, they are managed by the RPC framework.

## Solution
Implemented a GameEventBroker pattern to decouple WorldSimulation from GameRpcGrain:

1. **Created GameEventBroker Service** (`Services/GameEventBroker.cs`)
   - Singleton service that acts as an event broker
   - WorldSimulation publishes events to the broker
   - GameRpcGrain subscribes to events from the broker
   - Solves the issue where GameRpcGrain is created dynamically by RPC framework

2. **Updated WorldSimulation**
   - Removed direct IGameRpcGrain dependency
   - Removed direct event declarations
   - Uses GameEventBroker to raise game over and restart events
   - Injected GameEventBroker through constructor

3. **Updated GameRpcGrain**
   - Added GameEventBroker dependency
   - Subscribes to broker events in constructor
   - Removed OnDeactivateAsync cleanup (no longer needed)
   - Now properly receives game over notifications

4. **Updated Program.cs**
   - Registered GameEventBroker as singleton service
   - Ensures it's available to both WorldSimulation and GameRpcGrain

## Implementation Details

### GameEventBroker.cs
```csharp
public class GameEventBroker
{
    private readonly ConcurrentBag<Action<GameOverMessage>> _gameOverHandlers = new();
    private readonly ConcurrentBag<Action> _gameRestartHandlers = new();
    
    public void RaiseGameOver(GameOverMessage message) { /* notify handlers */ }
    public void RaiseGameRestart() { /* notify handlers */ }
    public void SubscribeToGameOver(Action<GameOverMessage> handler) { /* add handler */ }
    public void SubscribeToGameRestart(Action handler) { /* add handler */ }
}
```

### WorldSimulation Changes
```csharp
// Before: Direct RPC grain access (failing)
var gameGrain = _orleansClient.GetGrain<IGameRpcGrain>("game");
await gameGrain.NotifyObserversGameOver(gameOverMessage);

// After: Event broker pattern
_gameEventBroker.RaiseGameOver(gameOverMessage);
```

### GameRpcGrain Changes
```csharp
// In constructor
_gameEventBroker.SubscribeToGameOver(NotifyObserversGameOver);
_gameEventBroker.SubscribeToGameRestart(NotifyObserversGameRestarted);
```

## Benefits
1. Decouples WorldSimulation from RPC framework specifics
2. Allows GameRpcGrain to be created dynamically by RPC framework
3. Provides clean event-based communication
4. Eliminates the grain registration error
5. Supports multiple subscribers if needed in future

## Testing
After implementing this fix:
- Game over notifications should properly reach all connected RPC clients
- No more "Could not find an implementation for interface IGameRpcGrain" errors
- Game restart events should also propagate correctly
