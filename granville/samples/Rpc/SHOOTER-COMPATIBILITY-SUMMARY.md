# Shooter Sample Compatibility Summary

## Changes Made (2025-01-07)

### 1. Clarified Package Approach

Based on the discovery that only 5 Orleans assemblies were modified in the Granville fork, we updated the Shooter sample to use a hybrid package approach:

- **Shim packages** only for the 5 modified assemblies (Core, Core.Abstractions, Runtime, Serialization, Serialization.Abstractions)
- **Official Microsoft.Orleans packages** for all other unmodified assemblies
- **Granville packages** only for the actual implementations of the 5 modified assemblies

### 2. Updated Directory.Packages.props

Changed from using shim packages for all Orleans assemblies to:
- Shim packages only for the 5 modified assemblies
- Official Microsoft.Orleans packages (version 9.1.2) for Server, Client, Persistence.Memory, Reminders, etc.
- Removed unnecessary Granville package versions for unmodified assemblies

### 3. Updated Project Files

- **Shooter.Silo.csproj**: Removed unnecessary Granville package references for Server, Reminders, etc.
- **Shooter.ActionServer.csproj**: Updated to use official Microsoft.Orleans.Client package
- **Shooter.Silo/Program.cs**: Disabled AssemblyRedirectHelper (no longer needed with shim packages)

### 4. Created Documentation

- **HYBRID-PACKAGE-APPROACH.md**: Explains the correct package approach
- **SHOOTER-COMPATIBILITY-SUMMARY.md**: This file, documenting the changes

## Key Insight

The AssemblyRedirectHelper was failing because it was trying to redirect assemblies that don't need redirection. Only 5 Orleans assemblies were modified, so only those 5 need special handling via shim packages.

## Benefits

1. **Smaller footprint**: Only 5 shim packages instead of all Orleans packages
2. **Better compatibility**: Official packages work as expected for unmodified assemblies
3. **Cleaner solution**: No runtime assembly redirects needed
4. **Clear separation**: Easy to see which assemblies were modified vs unmodified

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated configuration with a clean build
2. Update build-shims.ps1 to only create shims for the 5 modified assemblies
3. Consider updating other samples to use this approach
4. Update the main compatibility documentation to clarify this approach
