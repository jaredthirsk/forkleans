## Implementation Summary (v130)

**✅ COMPLETED: Custom IGrainReferenceRuntime Approach**

The implementation successfully reuses Orleans' existing proxy generation infrastructure while routing calls through RPC's UDP transport. Key achievements:

1. **Zero Dynamic Code Generation** - Eliminated all Reflection.Emit usage
2. **Reused Orleans Infrastructure** - No need to duplicate proxy generation logic  
3. **Clean Architecture** - Transport concerns properly separated
4. **Better Performance** - No runtime code generation overhead
5. **AOT Compatible** - No dynamic types that would break ahead-of-time compilation
6. **Easier Debugging** - Generated proxy types are available at design time

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Runtime/RpcGrainReferenceRuntime.cs` (NEW)
- `src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Runtime/RpcRuntimeClient.cs` (NEW)  
- `src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/Hosting/DefaultRpcClientServices.cs` (MODIFIED)
- `src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/RpcGrainReferenceActivatorProvider.cs` (MODIFIED)
- `src/Rpc/Orleans.Rpc.Client/RpcInterfaceProxyFactory.cs` (DELETED)

**Verified Working:** Shooter sample builds and runs successfully with v130 packages.

## v132 Method ID Fix

**Issue:** RPC client was hanging after connecting due to method ID calculation mismatch.

**Root Cause:** `RpcGrainReferenceRuntime.GetMethodId()` was using `methodName.GetHashCode()` while the server expected sequential indices based on alphabetically sorted methods.

**Fix:** Updated `RpcGrainReferenceRuntime` to calculate method IDs the same way as `OutsideRpcRuntimeClient`:
1. Find the interface type from GrainInterfaceType
2. Get all public instance methods sorted alphabetically  
3. Return the index of the method in the sorted list

**Result:** RPC calls now properly route through the UDP transport to ActionServers.

## Note: Option B (Not Pursued)

**Option B** was compile-time code generation - creating a `Granville.Rpc.CodeGenerator` project to generate RPC-specific proxy classes at build time, similar to how Orleans generates its proxies. This would have involved:

- Creating a source generator or MSBuild task
- Scanning interfaces marked for RPC
- Generating proxy classes with method forwarding logic
- Integrating with the build system
- Packaging as a NuGet package

**Why we didn't pursue it:**

1. **Complexity**: Would require duplicating much of Orleans' proxy generation infrastructure
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Two separate proxy systems to maintain and keep in sync
3. **Unnecessary**: Orleans already generates high-quality proxies that we can reuse
4. **Better Solution Available**: The IGrainReferenceRuntime approach achieves all our goals with much less code
5. **Performance**: No evidence that custom proxies would perform better than Orleans proxies + runtime routing

The chosen approach (Option A) proved to be simpler, more maintainable, and fully sufficient for RPC's needs.
